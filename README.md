## Selected Technology Stack:
  - The test suite was designed using Cypress

## Reason Behind Using Framework:
- Used cypress because it makes web automation so seamless, it uses less dependency like selenium

- Also made use of the page object model to make sure that my code is maintainable and readable. Also made sure I made use of functions in a case where codes are reused mutiple times.

- I also implemented CI/CD with the use github action to make sure I can confidently deploy and merge to the main branch if I'm using multiple branches.

## How to Run 
- Clone/download Repo
- From the cloned repo, run "npm install" on the terminal of the folder containing the repo
- To open on web browser run "npm run open", to run on the terminal or headless run "npm run start"

## difference between severity and priority

- Severity is how a particular defect affects the functionality of a software
- Priority is the order in which a defect should be fixed


## Examples of High Severity, Low Priority:
- For example: If an application or web page crashes when a remote link is clicked, in this case clicking the remote link by an user is rare but the impact of  application crashing is severe. So the severity is high but priority is low.

## Examples Of High Priority, Low Severity:
- For example: If the company name is misspelled in the home page of the website, then the priority is high and severity is low to fix it.# decagon
